# FIU-ATOM-Datathon-COVID-19

## Things to do

- Add functionality to switch between the visualized data i.e race,testing positive/neg,pui,gender (see https://open-fdoh.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/florida-covid19-cases-by-county/data?geometry=-125.671%2C20.907%2C-42.044%2C34.477&page=7 for ideas) to local covid tracker

- Create a risk factor by counties column in the data based on age + testing and visualize that goes with prevrious bullet

- Risk factor data visuals + Risk factor look up by PID

- Maybe add questionaire to the web app (would have to do SQL inserts) and create a dummy login
